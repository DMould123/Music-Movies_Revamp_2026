```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file (see `.env.example`):

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
PORT=3001
```

4. Seed the database with movies:

```bash
npm run seed
```

5. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:3001`

### Client Setup

1. Navigate to client:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. (Optional) Create `.env` file:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

_If not set, the dev server will proxy API calls to localhost:3001_

4. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

Client runs on `http://localhost:3000`
